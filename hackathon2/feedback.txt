hello amecam this is a feedback to your hackaton project. I liked the snake game is well done.

I will point by the way that the screen in the beggining is open in a place that part of it is hidde in the top of the screen, 
so you can play but part of the screen is not visible. Also you cant resize the screen or move it down. 

Then when you lose you need close and start again the app instead of having the chance to close or select something. or to start again alone.

Still Your game is working and it is well done. Congratulations.
